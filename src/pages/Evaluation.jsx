            At N.M. Public School, our evaluation system is thoughtfully
            designed to foster holistic growth and academic excellence.
            Conducted on a terminal basis, it includes unit tests throughout the
            term for core subjects, ensuring continuous assessment and progress
            tracking.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            For skill-based subjects, we emphasize practical performance.
            Grading is based on studentsâ€™ demonstration of skills throughout the
            academic year, encouraging creativity, confidence, and mastery in a
            supportive learning environment.
